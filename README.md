## 1958-09-22 4:35 AM OMG I JUST KILLED A SOC! 
Me and Ponyboy got in a tussle with those Soc's in that cursed Blue Mustang and next thing I know, I pull a Knife and stabbed a guy
one too many times. My heart aches and I'm going to have to live with that regret. But at least I stopped them From doing what they did 
to me to Ponyboy. We're now runnning away. I can't say where tho. Will keep you guys posted.

Sorry that I haven't been posting. I just got internet. Who would've guess that this old Church had wifi? Really cool too since it's 1958! Right now I have nothing to do, so expect regular updates.

## 1958-09-31 11:30 AM JOHNNY NEEDS YOUR HELP
Hey guys, Pony here. I normally don't post on Johnny's blog as it's his business and watnot, but Im going to be keeping it in check for a little while, untill he gets better. What's really important is that JOHNNY GOT HURT. We tried to save children from a burning fire but a large piece of rubble hit him and now he's in critical condition. So we set him up a Go Fund Me.

## Rip Johnny Cade 1949-1965

Johnny Cade passed away due to complications in the hospital. The doctors couldn't save him. Our Heart is broken, all of us. He was oyr brother, he was our friend. Johnny is not dead tho. He was somewhere else-maybe asleep in the lot, or playing the pinball machine in the bowling alley, or sitting on the back stepsof the church in Windrixville. He'll be there, for us. But now, his readers no longer have a home. I cannot continue this, I'm sorry.
